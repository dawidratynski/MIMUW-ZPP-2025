In the current setup the application will hot-reload on any changes in the /app directory.

Any changes outside /app directory will require you to re-build the image to apply.

## Build image :
```
docker compose build
```


## Run application in current terminal session:
```
docker compose up
```

## Run application in the background:
```
docker compose up -d
```

## Stop application running in the background:
```
docker compose down
```
